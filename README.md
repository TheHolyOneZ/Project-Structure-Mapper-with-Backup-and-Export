# Project-Structure-Mapper-with-Backup-and-Export

This Python script is designed to scan and map the folder structure of a specified project directory. It generates a backup of the entire project to ensure safety before proceeding. The script then outputs the folder structure into both text and markdown files, creating a clean, visually formatted representation of the project layout. The markdown file is ideal for sharing on platforms like GitHub, while the text file offers a simple, readable format for quick reference.

**Key features include:**

 - Project backup: Safely copies the entire project directory before making any changes.

 - Project structure mapping: Recursively maps the folder and file structure.

 - Output formats: Generates both .txt and .md files for easy documentation and sharing.

 - UTF-8 encoding: Handles all characters and special symbols.

This script is perfect for developers looking to document their project structures or share them with collaborators, while ensuring a backup of the project is safely created.
